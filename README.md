To run the solution:

    # create a new React app (I already ran this, it's what created this git repo and all the boilerplate)
    npx create-react-app devprojects-weather-forecast

    # install the deps
    cd devprojects-weather-forecast
    npm install

    # run the dev server (with live reloading)
    npm start

    # Run the test suite
    npm test

    # Build a minified, optimized version that you can deploy (output is in ./build/)
    npm run build
